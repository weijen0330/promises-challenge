  In this challenge, you'll learn how to use promises to make independent requests as well as how to make dependendent requests

  Part 1: Return what the current weather is based on a user's location (you can't use the location API though ;)

  - When you click the Weather button, the current weather should be shown in the #weather-results section
  - Use http://www.ip-api.com/json/ to get a user's location. This uses your IP address to get an estimate of your location
  - With the result of that request, make another request to determine the current weather
    - Use http://openweathermap.org/current
    - The API is really straightforward, but you'll have to pass an additional parameter to getJSON in order to get it working!
      - Take a look at jQuery's getJSON() API to see what that extra parameter is! http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/
  
  Part 2: Show the difference between parallel and serial promises

  - Below I've implemented a couple of promises that just use timeouts, and return numbers
  - When the user clicks the serial button: each of the promises will execute one by one, and you will return the result in #slow-result
  - When the user clicks the parallel button: each of the promises will execute at the same time, and you will return the result in #fast-result
  - This is to show the immense importance of network optimization!
  
  Part 3: Modify the promise factory to create promises that can FAIL
  
  - The promise factory currently only returns promises that resolve
  - Use the deferred.fail() method to instead make it fail (https://api.jquery.com/deferred.fail/)
  - Now update you're code to handle dealing with these errors!
  - Congrats, you can now model asynchronous events entirely in your code :)

  // The stuff below is for part 2 and 3

  // Creates a promise that will take delay ms before resolving with the given value
  // Don't worry about how this works, but if you want you're curious feel free to ask!
  function promiseFactory(delay, val) {
    function f() {
      var d = $.Deferred();

      setTimeout(function() {
        d.resolve(val);
      }, delay);

      return d.promise();
    }

    return f;
  }

  var quick = promiseFactory(500, 5);
  // quick(); executes the promise
  var medium = promiseFactory(1000, 2);
  var slow = promiseFactory(2000, 30)

  // $.when(...) {}

});
